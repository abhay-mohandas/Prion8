# Prion8
- 8 bit architecture and instruction length.
- 16 bit address length.
- 1/2/4/8 bytes -> byte, half-word, word, double-word
- Separate Instruction, Data and System space. Each 2^16 bytes.
  - Virtual address is used for Instruction and Data space.
  - System Space will be split for various uses.
- 8x8-bit General Purpose Registers: RA,RB,RC,RD,R0,R1,R2,R3.
- 16x16-bit Special Purpose Registers: CTRL,FAULT,FLAGS,IP,PG,SP,MADDR,IOR,OPEX,etc.

## Register Usage:
- RA-D reg are general purpose register to temporarily store values, perform ALU operation or have predefined uses.
- R0-3 reg are general purpose register to temporarily store values or perform ALU operation.
- CTRL reg is used to configure the system behaviour.
- FAULT reg is used to store the error information.
- FLAGS reg is used to store different flags like Carry, Zero, etc.
- IR reg is the Program Counter, used to point to the instruction address.
- PG reg is used to store the base paging address, Page size of 256 bytes.
- SP reg is the Stack Pointer register, used for push, pop, etc.
- MADDR reg is used for address related instructions like jump/load/store.
- IOR reg is used for I/O operations, holds the values to/from I/O devices.
- OPEX reg is used for opcode extension and holds the Opcode Set number.
	--Defines the behaviour of opcodes from 0x80[7:3]-0xFC[7:3] (32 ops in total) based on the Opcode Set number.
	--This increases the theoretical limit of ops from 32 to over 2M(32*(2**16)) ops.
	--Disabled if CTRL.OE is 0 and the ops will have the behaviour of Opcode Set 0.
